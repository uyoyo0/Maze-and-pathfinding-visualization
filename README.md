# Maze-and-pathfinding-visualization
This project aims to visualize recursive backtracking, the breadth first search and the depth first search through the solving and generations of mazes.

Some useful tips when trying out the program:
- You can toggle the animation speed by clicking 1,2 and 3
- You can pause and un-pause the animation by clicking "p"
- You can toggle between a grid and non-grid view by clicking "g"
- You can attempt to traverse the maze yourself by using the WASD keys

P.S.
I created this project in grade 11 after finishing a course in computer science offered by my highschool which is why alot of the code is messy
I hope you enjoy playing around with it :)
